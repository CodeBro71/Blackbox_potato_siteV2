            <h1>The Great Irish Potato Famine</h1>
            <p>The Great Irish Potato Famine, also known as the Great Hunger, began in 1845 when a mold known as Phytophthora infestans (or P. infestans) caused a destructive plant disease that spread rapidly throughout Ireland. The infestation ruined up to one-half of the potato crop that year, and about three-quarters of the crop over the next seven years. Because the tenant farmers of Ireland—then ruled as a colony of Great Britain—relied heavily on the potato as a source of food, the infestation had a catastrophic impact on Ireland and its population.</p>
            <p>The famine resulted in the death and emigration of millions of people, and had a profound impact on the country's demographics and economy. The population of Ireland dropped from about 8 million in 1841 to about 6 million in 1851, and did not recover to its pre-famine level until the 20th century.</p>
